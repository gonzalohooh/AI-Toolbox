## Introduction

AI-Toolbox is a collection of projects demonstrating the application of AI algorithms in various fields. Each project is presented in a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to follow along and understand the implementation details.

## Installation

To get started with the notebooks, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required packages using the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on the AI domain:

- **computer_vision**: Contains notebooks related to computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image generation.
- **natural_language_processing**: Contains notebooks related to NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and language modeling.
- **signal_processing**: Contains notebooks related to signal processing tasks such as time-series analysis and speech recognition.

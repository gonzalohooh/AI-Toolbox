## Notebooks

### Computer Vision

**1. GAN for Biomedical Image Generation**
- **Description**: This notebook demonstrates the training of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic chest X-ray images.
- **File**: `notebooks/computer_vision/Chest_X-Ray_Generator_GAN.ipynb`

### Natural Language Processing

**1. Named Entity Recognition with ALBERT**
- **Description**: This notebook demonstrates named entity recognition (NER) using the ALBERT model on a sample biomedical dataset. The notebook shows how to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
- **File**: `notebooks/natural_language_processing/Biomedical_Albert_NER.ipynb`

### Signal Processing

**1. EEG Data Classification using Recurrent Neural Networks**
- **Description**: This notebook demonstrates the classification of EEG (Electroencephalogram) data to determine whether a person's eyes are open or closed using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). It uses the EEG Eye State dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, preprocesses it, trains an LSTM model, and evaluates its performance.

### Bioinformatics

**1. Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset Analysis and Machine Learning**
- **Description**:  This notebook demonstrates the analysis of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset and applies machine learning to predict if a tumor is malignant or benign. The steps include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and training a Random Forest classifier.
- **File**: `notebooks/bioinformatics/Breast_Cancer_Analysis.ipynb`


### Reinforcement Learning

**1. Reinforcement Learning for Optimizing Medication Dosage**
- **Description**: This notebook demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in optimizing the dosage of a medication over time to maximize patient health outcomes.
- **File**: `notebooks/reinforcement_learning/Medication_Dosage_Optimization.ipynb`
